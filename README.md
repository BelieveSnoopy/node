Example node express app

I hope you guys are having a good day so far. This is a very simple Express App built with node.
I tried to implement a login feature and make it as simple as possible.

Before you try to run this app, make sure you have the necessary Node Modules installed. Try running the commands below to install them:

npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install express-session

After installing those modules, open your command prompt in the "sample" folder. (if you don't know how to do this, try running this command in your CMD:

"cd Desktop/node/sample")

Once you're in that folder, run the script.js file using Node. To do that, run the following command in your CMD: "node script.js".

Then open your browser and type "localhost:1337/login" in the URL.

That should be it! If you still have any question, don't hesitate to contact me.
